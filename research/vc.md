| Investor | Stage | Thesis Fit | Notes |
|----------|-------|------------|-------|
| **Thayer Ventures** | Seed+ | HIGH | Travel & transportation tech specialists since 2009 |
| **F-Prime Capital** | Seed+ | HIGH | $6.5B AUM, travel tech portfolio (Deal Engine, TripSuite) |
| **MairDuMont Ventures** | Early-stage | HIGH | German travel-focused VC, B2C/B2B digital travel |
| **HOWZAT Partners** | Seed+ | MEDIUM | Digital businesses including travel, Luxembourg-based |

### Tier 2: European Early-Stage Generalists
| Investor | Stage | Thesis Fit | Notes |
|----------|-------|------------|-------|
| **Speedinvest** | Pre-seed/Seed | HIGH | EUR 1.2B AUM, TourRadar in portfolio, Vienna-based |

| **Rockaway Ventures** | Late-seed/Series A | MEDIUM | EUR 55M fund, Central Europe + DACH |

### Tier 3: Global VCs (Later Stage Focus)
| Investor | Stage | Thesis Fit | Notes |
|----------|-------|------------|-------|
| **a16z** | Series A+ | LOW | $2.8B deployed in AI 2024, infrastructure-focused |
| **Sequoia** | Series A+ | LOW | "AI-first companies," OpenAI/Anthropic focus |
| **General Catalyst** | Series A+ | LOW | Active in AI but later-stage preference |

**Note on Tier 1 VCs:** a16z and Sequoia have shifted away from early-stage toward later-stage, de-risked opportunities. Pre-seed travel tech is better served by specialized travel VCs and European early-stage funds.
